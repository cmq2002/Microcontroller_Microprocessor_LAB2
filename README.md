# Microcontroller_Microprocessor_LAB2
Each exercise contains STM32 Project as well as Proteus Simulation:
- To achieve Ex4 we only need to change the counter in Ex3 so there's no need to create a new project
- Since Ex7 and Ex8 will sucessively enhance Ex5, they will be integrated into STM32 project of Ex5
